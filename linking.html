<h2 align="center">Introduction to web</h2>
 Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client.The client uses web browser to send request to the server.The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language).All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.client and server functioning

The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet.The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server.The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol,which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.
TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange.TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets.IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.

<p>
<h2 align="center">Components of Web Application</h2>
All web-based database applications have three primary components:A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application.
The database server sometimes also provides business logic in the form of stored procedures. Stored procedures can offer significant performance advantages, especially in a multi-tiered architecture.In addition to database servers, other enterprise information system componentsinclude IMS databases, IBM® MQ messages, and CICS® records.
The clients handle the presentation logic, which controls the way in which users interact with the application. 
In some cases, the client validates user-provided input. Web applications sometimes integrate Java™ applets into the client-side logic to improve the presentation layer.

<h2 align="center">Types of Web Content</h2>
Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable,encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets buildon the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.Web components are based on existing web standards. Features to support web components are currently being added to the HTML and DOM specs, letting web developers easily extend HTML with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

<h2 align="center">Overview of HTTP - HTTP request – response</h2>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communicationfor the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods,error codes, and headers.

<a href id="Generation of dynamic web pages"></a>
<p>
<h2 align="center">Generation of dynamic web pages</h2>
A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an applicationserver processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how theassembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser asit loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query pagestate and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can stillbe hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.

<a href id="Web Security"></a>
<p>
<h2 align="center">web security</h2>
Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft ofsoftware, hardware, or data. It includes protecting computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Protection of a virtual private network (VPN) also falls under the web security umbrella.
